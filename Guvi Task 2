Qust 1 Create a file with .txt extension (/home/demo.txt). Change the permission set of that file, so that any user can read it, group can read/write & owner can read/write/execute it.

Ans : i used the cmd called chmod and there was 3 type of permission was there there was 
u= user
g= group
o= other
for changing the permision we need to use the cmd called chmod permission and another way was there to change the mode by digit 
0   No Permission         --
1   Execute permission    --X
2   Write permission      -W-
3   Exe + Write Perm     -WX
4   Read Perm            R--
5   Read + Exec Per      R-X
6   Read + Write perm    RW-
7   Read+Write+Exe      RWX
